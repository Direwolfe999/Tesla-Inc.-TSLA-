1. Transaction History & Ledger (Non-negotiable)

Real trading apps always have a ledger.

What to add

Deposit / withdrawal history

Trade executions

Fees, timestamps, status (pending, completed, failed)

Why it feels premium
Users can audit their own money. This builds trust.

Upgrade idea

Click any transaction → detailed modal (TX ID, balance before/after)

2. Order Types (Market, Limit, Stop)

Right now you probably only have “buy” or “sell”.

Add

Market orders

Limit orders

Stop-loss & take-profit

Why
This instantly separates a real trading platform from a demo.

Pro touch
Show “Estimated execution price” before confirmation.

3. Live Price Feed (WebSockets)

Polling = amateur. Streaming = pro.

Add

WebSocket or Supabase Realtime channel

Price ticks update without refresh

Feels premium because

Numbers move smoothly

No page reloads

Feels like Binance / TradingView

4. Advanced Charts (TradingView-style)

Charts sell the illusion of seriousness.

Add

Candlestick charts

Timeframes (1m, 5m, 1h, 1d)

Indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD)

Tools

Recharts (basic)

Bonus
Dark mode chart by default 😏

5. Open Positions & PnL Tracking

Users want to feel profit/loss.

Add

Open positions table

Real-time PnL (green/red)

Premium effect
Live PnL changing in real time = dopamine.

6. Risk Management Controls

This is where platforms feel institutional.

Add

Max position size

Risk % per trade

Auto stop-loss suggestions

Why it matters
It shows you care about user safety — very “regulated platform” vibe.

7. KYC-Ready Account Levels (Even if Mocked)

Even if you’re not doing KYC yet — structure for it.

Add

Account tiers (Basic, Verified, Pro)

Withdrawal limits per tier

Premium illusion
Users expect restrictions — weirdly, restrictions = trust.

8. Notifications System (In-App + Email)

Silence feels cheap.

Add

Deposit successful

Withdrawal pending/completed

Price alerts

Stop-loss hit

Tech

Supabase triggers → notifications table

Toasts + bell icon + unread count

9. Fees, Spreads & Transparency Panel

Real trading apps always show fees.

Add

Trading fee %

Withdrawal fee

Spread preview

Pro move
Show:

“Estimated fee: $2.34”

It builds credibility even if fees are small.

10. Security & Trust Signals (Huge for Premium Feel)

Users won’t say it, but they feel it.

Add

Session management (active sessions list)

2FA toggle (even if stubbed)

Login history (IP, device)

Visual cues

Shield icons

“Secured by encryption” labels

Subtle green checks
