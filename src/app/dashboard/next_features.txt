What to add next (sentences only, no code)
1. Transaction status lifecycle

Add a proper lifecycle for deposits and withdrawals: pending → processing → completed / failed.
This instantly makes deposits feel “real”, not just numbers jumping.

2. Balance locking during withdrawal

When a user initiates a withdrawal, lock that amount so it can’t be traded or withdrawn again until completion.
This prevents race conditions and makes your system bank-grade.

3. Balance before & after snapshots

Store the wallet balance before and after every transaction.
This gives you a full audit trail and lets users trust their account history.

4. Unified activity feed

Merge trades, deposits, withdrawals, and system events into one activity timeline.
Real platforms don’t separate “money” and “trading” — everything lives together.

5. Pending transactions section

Show a separate section for pending withdrawals and deposits.
Users feel calmer when they can see money is on the way.

6. Withdrawal limits & cooldowns

Add daily withdrawal limits and cooldown timers after large withdrawals.
This adds realism and protects against abuse.

7. Fee transparency

Show:

Deposit fee (even if 0%)

Withdrawal fee

Trading fee per transaction
Premium platforms always show fees before confirmation.

8. Real-time PnL indicator

Show unrealized profit/loss updating live as prices move.
This is one of the biggest “this feels like Binance” moments.

9. Account level system

Introduce account tiers (Basic / Verified / Pro) with different limits and features.
Even if verification is fake for now, the structure makes the platform feel serious.

10. Security & trust indicators

Add visible signals like:

“Last login”

“Active sessions”

“2FA available”
Users trust what they can see.

Specifically for your deposit & withdraw flow (critical upgrades)

Right now, deposits and withdrawals feel instant and optimistic.
To upgrade that:

Add a short “processing” state (even 1–2 seconds)

Disable all action buttons during processing

Prevent multiple submissions

Add withdrawal review / approval simulation

Show estimated completion time

These small UX delays increase perceived legitimacy.
