Next recommended steps (pick any):

Run the migration SQL in your Supabase SQL editor (paste the file contents) to create the tables and functions.
Populate profiles for existing users (ensure profiles.id = auth.users.id) 
if you already have users — otherwise the FK will require creating profiles on signup (your SignUp code already inserts a profile).
Test end-to-end: sign up → ensure wallet created → login → deposit/withdraw in Dashboard → verify rows in transactions.
Add an admin account: set is_admin = TRUE for a profile in the profiles table (via SQL or Supabase Table Editor) to test admin privileges.
(Optional) I can add a migration commit to your repo and open a PR, or keep it as a .sql file for you to run manually.
Would you like me to commit the migration to git (I already added the file to the workspace) and make a small commit, or do you want to run the SQL yourself in the Supabase dashboard first?
